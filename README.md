# ShopifyMonitor
Requirements: 
Beautiful Soup.
Colorama.
Discord, you need to enter your webhook into the discurl variable (Optional, comment discord lines out if you do not want it).
Twitter module I wrote, it's terrible but it works, you have to enter your twitter info for it to work.
Probably other stuff I'm forgetting
